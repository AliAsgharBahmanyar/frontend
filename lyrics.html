        [Verse 1]
        Oh, I cannot explain
        Every time, it's the same
        Oh, I feel that it's real, take my heart
        I've been lonely too long
        Oh, I can't be so strong
        Take a chance for romance, take my heart
        I need you so
        There's no time, I'll ever go

        [Chorus]
        Cheri Cheri Lady, goin' through emotion
        Love is where you find it, listen to your heart
        Cheri Cheri Lady, livin' in devotion
        It's always like the first time, let me take a part
        Cheri Cheri Lady, like there's no tomorrow
        Take my heart, don't lose it, listen to your heart
        Cheri Cheri Lady, to know you is to love you
        If you call me, baby, I'll be always yours

        [Verse 2]
        I get up, I get down
        All my world turns around
        Who is right? Who is wrong? I don't know
        I've got pain in my heart, got a love in my soul
        Easy come, but I think easy go
        I need you so
        All the times, I move so slow
